# Language
Eventhough you can get by without learning Russian in the university, you will miss out a lot if you don't. There are very few people outside of Innopolis that can converse in English fluently and the nubmer of people that can converse in your native languages is even fewer. Further more, most of the talks and seminars given in the university will be in Russian. Learning Russian will make travelling less of a hassle, and who knows, maybe even to make friends with a few locals

The most important tool you need to have before landing is the **offline** version of the Translate application (Google or Yandex), it will be your best friend for a few months. Yandex Translate offers more accuracy translating from russian and vice-versa

It is better to have realistic expectations about learning Russian. That will save you a lot of time and avoid confusion. Give [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130195821/https://www.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/bzqz08/the_russian_learning_journey_tips_truths_myths/) a read first.

### General Tips From Polyglots
