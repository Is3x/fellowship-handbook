You have 3 possible options for having food: University canteens, restaurants inside the University and in the city, and the last option is to buy food ingredients from a supermarket and cook by yourself.

We will now explain each of these options in more details.

1. University canteens: there is a canteen on the first floor of the University next to the reading hall and another one on the first floor in the first dorm. The canteens offers you the main meals so you can rely on them as the main source for food if you are satisfied with the price of the food and the quantity of the food offered.
2. Restaurants inside the University and in the city: you will find some restaurants in the first floor in the University and in different areas in the city. This is considered to be the most expensive option for getting food, but still you can use it sometimes if you want. You can order the food using "Яндекс еда" mobile application.
3. Cooking by yourself: this is the cheapest option for getting food. You can buy the food ingredients from the supermarket and cook them by yourself in your room.
