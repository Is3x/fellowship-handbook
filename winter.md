Russia is not cold all year long, April to October are summer months with temprature ranging from +10 to +30 degrees, the rest is winter where temprature can drop to -25 degrees.

## Clothes

As the wether can be verry cold you will need:
- Coat
- Boots
- Thermal underware (optional)

Tips:
- It's better to buy the winter clothes from Russia.
- Ask your russian friends where they buy their winter clothes to get it cheaper.
- Have multiple layers of clothes so you can take off your coat when you enter an air conditioned place.
